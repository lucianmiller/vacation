    <h1>Vacation</h1>
    <p>The place I really want to go on Vacation to is Alaska. There are so many fun things to do there. Here are some of them.</p>

    <h2>Sled Dogs</h2>
    <p>I've always wanted to be pulled by sled dogs. It seems very fun and the dogs seem to really enjoy it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can also travel from one place to the other</li>
      <li>The history behind sled dog racing seems interesting</li>
      <li>Everyone enjoys it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Northern Lights</h2>
    <p>The Aurora Borealis is a natural phanomanon that occurs closer to the north pole</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's something I've always wanted to see</li>
      <li>The Aurora is beautiful</li>
      <li>I'd never get tired of looking at it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testimonies</h2>
    <p>Alaska is beautiful. Everyone should go there at least once.</p>
